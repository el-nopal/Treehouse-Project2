=== Treehouse FEWD PROJECT 2 - Mobile-first Responsive Layout ===

Description:
In this project, I built a responsive, mobile-first layout using HTML and CSS. The layout demonstrates an understanding of responsive design by adjusting to accommodate small, medium, and large screen sizes.

I wrote CSS to style the page for a small mobile device first. Then, using min-width media queries, I added breakpoints to adjust the layout for wider tablet and desktop screens.
